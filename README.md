# Data-Analytics
Start and progress of my data analytics career 

After teaching for seven years in the public school sector I wanted to transition into something more self driven and challenging. I had always been interested in technology and wanted to do something in that field. As I looked through various career certificates and onnline courses I found the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course and that really peaked my interest. I love solving problems and learning new things so it was a natural fit. Here I will share my learning of SQL, R, and any other tools I will need and use for my hopeful career in data analytics.
